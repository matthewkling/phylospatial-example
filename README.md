# phylospatial-example

This project contains the code and data for the example spatial phylogenetic analysis included in the paper "`phylospatial`: an R package for spatial phylogenetic analysis with quantitative community data".

Running the script "phylospatial.R" should reproduce Figure 3 of the paper.

The data used in this example are originally from the following studies:
- Thornhill et al. 2017: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-017-0435-x
- Kling et al. 2018: https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2017.0397
